In this project a Raspberry Pi 3 serves as the main node hosting the MQTT broker (i.e. mosquitto), and an Arduino uno WIFI rev board and smart phone publish and subcribes to topics.

This smart home project consits of:

* A lighting system that switches on automatically when sensors identify a human in a room.

* A smart heating system that detects any temperature change in the house and automatically adjusts the temperature to the home owner's preferred setting.

* A home intruder detector that sounds an alarm if someone attempts to break into a guarded area.

**Note:** **First download the powerpoint presentation at https://hshl.sciebo.de/s/wSpKQ4vEtA8GkZB to get started (it contains video demonatrations that can only be viewed if downloaded). Then view the code (i.e. the smart_home.ino file) in the smart_home directory.**
