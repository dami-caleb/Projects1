A MATLAB/Simulink module for the house heater control system. The module includes models for temperature sensing, heating element control, and user interface, which have been thoroughly tested and validated.

The temperature sensing model features an adjustable setpoint with a PID controller for accurate and responsive temperature regulation. The heating element control model utilizes pulse-width modulation (PWM) for efficient power management, and can be configured for different heating elements with varying power ratings. The user interface model provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for users to set temperature setpoints, view current temperature readings, and monitor heater status.

In addition to the main Simulink module, several utility functions have also been added to facilitate the testing and debugging of the system. These functions include signal generators for temperature and control signals, scopes for real-time visualization of temperature and control signals, and diagnostic tools for detecting faults and troubleshooting the system.

The Simulink module has been integrated with the existing control system software, and the system as a whole has been tested and verified for correct functionality. Documentation has been updated to reflect the changes made, including descriptions of the new models and functions, usage instructions, and troubleshooting tips.

This commit represents a significant improvement to the house heater control system, and is expected to provide increased reliability, efficiency, and user-friendliness.
